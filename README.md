# go-bls-signatures

> Pure Go implemenation of <https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures>

Implements the [BLS12-381 curve](https://z.cash/blog/new-snark-curve/).

Note that when referring to this curve, the "BLS" is "Barreto-Lynn-Scott", for the curve, not to be confused with the Boneh–Lynn–Shacham signature scheme, also called "BLS".

## Obligatory Warning: I am not a cryptographer. This should be considered alpha-level software at best. Use at your own risk!

This work is derived from an earlier version of [an existing project by Julian Meyer](https://github.com/phoreproject/bls) which is a port of the zkcrypto Rust implementation (that project does not implement the Chia spec).
